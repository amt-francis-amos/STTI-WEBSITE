        <h1>Our  <span>History</span></h1>
        <p>The Sekondi-Takorodi Technical Institute(S.T.T.I) previously known and called Takoradi Vocational Training Institute (TVTI) was established on 22nd September, 1998 by His Excellency John Evans Fiifi Atta Mills through the initiative of the government of Ghana in partnership with the Department for International Development(DFID) project. It was established to provide the best employable TVET skills and services to the youth in the region and to raise training to the middle level manpower requirement, to meet the modern technological trend.
